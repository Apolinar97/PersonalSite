# Overview

A fast, responsive single page application built to showcase my projects, skills, and to help me build my personal brand.

## Goal

I wanted to showcase my work and build my personal brand, while also learning a modern framework. Vue had been on my radar, so this project let me accomplish both goals: put myself out there and expand my tech stack.

## How I Built It

- Designed a simple, consistent layout with reusable components and clear navigation.
- Given the small scale of my site, I decided on keeping the content for my projects in a JSON file to act as my project database and markdown files for the content of my project write ups for simplicity.
- Focused on mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and on presenting a professional site showcasing myself.
- Hosted on Vercel and used Vercel Blob to host static content.

## Outcomes
- Successfully deployed live site with custom domain.
- Clear project presentation with a detail page.
- Consistent UX across mobile and desktop users.
- Content updates via JSON/markdown without needing to redeploy.
- Learned how to register my own domain and assign it to an application.

## Roadmap

- Maintain this site as a living document of myself and my current and past work.
- Add more project case studies.
