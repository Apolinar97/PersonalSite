# Overview
An Idea to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS with the intentions of futhering my knowledge and experience building pipelines using a cloud infrastructure.

The idea is to explore the full lifecycle of a data pipeline from ingestion and transformation to storage and visualization using AWS services. The project is currently in the design and planning phase, with architecture, tooling, and data sources still being evaluated.
## Goal

Create a production-grade ETL pipeline that demonstrates core data engineering principles using AWS infrastructure. The project aims to building practical experience with AWS' core data tools, culminating in a connected analytics dashboard.
## How I Built It
**_TBD_**

## Outcomes
**_Project in planning  Expected outcomes to be:**
1. Hands on experience evaluating AWS data services and their appropriate use cases
2. A clearer understanding of how modern data pipelines are designed on AWS
3. A well documented project to demostrate my skills and understanding

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Exploration and Discovery

The goal of this phase is to define the problem space and constraints before committing to specific tools or patterns.

**Activities in this phase may include:**
1. Researching common AWS based data pipeline architectures
2. Evaluating potential data sources and their characteristics
3. Identifying requirements around scale, cost, and complexity
4. Reviewing best practices for security, access control, and data organization

### Phase 2: Design and Prototyping

Once initial options are evaluated and data source(s) is/are selected, this phase focuses on small scale experimentation to validate assumptions.

**Activities may include:**
1. Prototyping simple ingestion and transformation workflows
2. Testing data organization strategies within S3
3. Experimenting with basic data models for analytics 
4. Define architecture
5. Refining the proposed architecture based on findings

### Phase 3 Implementation and Iteration

After an initial design direction is selected, this phase shifts toward building and refining the pipeline.

**Planned activities include:**

1. Implementing the selected ingestion and transformation approach  
2. Loading curated data into the chosen database or warehouse 
3. Introducing scheduling and basic orchestration
4. Iterating on the design based on usability and performance

### Phase 4 Analytics and Reflection

The final phase focuses on enabling analytics and capturing lessons learned.

**Planned Activities include:**

1. Connecting a BI or visualization tool to the curated data  
2. Building exploratory dashboards for key metrics
3. Documenting architectural decisions and trade offs  
4. Writing a final project summary and retrospective
