# Overview

A fast, responsive portfolio site built to showcase my work, skills, and contact information with a clean, professional presentation.

## Problem

I needed a single, modern place to present projects and experience that looks polished on desktop and mobile, loads quickly, and is easy to update.

## Approach

- Designed a simple, consistent layout with clear navigation.
- Built reusable components for cards, skills, and contact details.
- Kept content in markdown/JSON for easy updates.
- Focused on performance, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.

## Results

- Clear project presentation with detail pages.
- Consistent UX across devices and screen sizes.
- Easy content updates without touching layout code.

## Next Steps

- Add more project case studies.
- Refine copy and visuals.
- Add a blog or writing section.
